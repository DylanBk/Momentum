# Momentum

## What is Momentum?

Momentum is a productivity web app designed with the intent to allow people to track tasks they need to do and mark them as done when completed, this lets people see a visual indicator of how much stuff they have achieved and what needs to be done.

## How was Momentum built?

The front end side of the site is composed of React, TailwindCSS, and plain CSS whilst the back end is built using Flask and SQLAlchemy. The fetch API is used to make requests to the server and Flask is used to handle those requests, and SQLAlchemy handles all database interactions.
